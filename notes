Pattern Explanation:
1. Mongoose Schema and Model Definition
Pattern: Mongoose Schema is used to define the structure of the User model. The fields are defined with types and constraints (required, unique, trim, lowercase, etc.).
Flow: Whenever a new user document is created or updated, it must conform to this structure, ensuring data consistency in the database.
js
Copy code
const userSchema = new Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, lowercase: true, trim: true, index: true },
  // other fields...
});
2. Password Hashing with bcrypt
Pattern: Pre-save Middleware (userSchema.pre("save")) ensures that the user's password is securely hashed before saving it to the database.
Flow: Before saving a new user or updating an existing user's password, the pre("save") hook checks if the password has been modified. If yes, it hashes the password using bcrypt and saves the hashed version.
js
Copy code
userSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
  if (!this.isModified("password")) {
    return next();
  }
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10);
  next();
});
3. Password Comparison
Pattern: A method (isPasswordCorrect) is defined on the user model to compare a provided plaintext password with the stored hashed password.
Flow: When a user logs in, the provided password is compared with the hashed password in the database using bcrypt.compare(). This ensures that the application can authenticate the user without ever storing the plaintext password.
js
Copy code
userSchema.methods.isPasswordCorrect = async function (password) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};
4. Token Generation with JWT
Pattern: JWT is used to generate both access tokens and refresh tokens for user authentication.

Flow: After successfully logging in or registering, the server generates an access token containing user information (e.g., _id, email, username) using jwt.sign(). The token is signed with a secret key and has an expiration time.

Access Token: Used for short-lived, temporary access to protected routes.

Refresh Token: Used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.

js
Copy code
userSchema.methods.generateAccessToken = function () {
  return jwt.sign(
    { _id: this._id, email: this.email, username: this.username, fullname: this.fullname },
    process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY }
  );
};
5. Handling Token Expiry and Refreshing
Pattern: When an access token expires, the client can use a refresh token to request a new access token without needing to log in again. The refresh token has a longer expiration time.
Flow: When the refresh token is sent to the server, it is verified, and if valid, a new access token is issued.
js
Copy code
userSchema.methods.generateRefreshToken = function () {
  return jwt.sign(
    { _id: this._id },
    process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET,
    { expiresIn: process.env.REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY }
  );
};
6. User Schema Flexibility
Pattern: The user schema includes flexible fields like avatar, coverImage, and watchHistory. These allow for easy expansion and management of user-related data (e.g., profile pictures, cover images, and watched videos).
Flow: As the application evolves, fields can be easily added or removed to the schema without breaking existing functionality.
Flow Summary:
Registration:

User submits registration data.
Password is hashed.
User document is saved to the database.
Login:

User submits login credentials.
Password is compared with the hashed password.
If correct, an access token and refresh token are generated.
Protected Route Access:

User sends access token with each request.
Token is verified before granting access.
Token Expiry:

If the access token expires, the refresh token is used to generate a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
Error Handling:

If authentication fails, the user receives an error response, either due to incorrect credentials or an expired/invalid token.
Advantages of This Pattern:
Security: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, and tokens are signed using JWT, ensuring secure authentication and communication.
Scalability: The use of a schema allows for easy expansion of user data fields without major code changes.
Separation of Concerns: The logic for token generation, password hashing, and user authentication is well-separated and encapsulated in methods attached to the schema.
This pattern is highly suitable for applications requiring secure user authentication, especially in modern web apps.
